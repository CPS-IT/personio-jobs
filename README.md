---

An extension for TYPO3 CMS that integrates jobs from Personio Recruiting API
into TYPO3. It provides a console command to import jobs into modern-typed
value objects. In addition, plugins for list and detail views are provided
with preconfigured support for Bootstrap v5 components.

## üöÄ Features

* Console command to import jobs from Personio Recruiting API
* Usage of modern-typed value objects during the import process
* Plugins for list and detail view
* Optional support for JSON Schema on job detail pages using [EXT:schema][1]
* Compatible with TYPO3 11.5 LTS

## üî• Installation

### Composer

```bash
composer require cpsit/typo3-personio-jobs
```

üí° If you want to use the [JSON schema](#json-schema) feature, you must
additionally require the `schema` extension:

```bash
composer require brotkrueml/schema
```

### TER

Alternatively, you can download the extension via the
[TYPO3 extension repository (TER)][2].

### First-step configuration

Once installed, make sure to include the TypoScript setup at
`EXT:personio_jobs/Configuration/TypoScript` in your root template.

## ‚ö° Usage

### Plugins

The extension provides two plugins:

* **`Personio: Job list`** lists all imported jobs as unordered list. Each list
  item shows the job title, office and schedule and links to the job's detail
  view.
* **`Personio: Job detail`** shows a single job, including several job properties
  and all imported job descriptions. In addition, it renders a button to apply
  for the job.

### Command-line usage

#### `personio-jobs:import`

```bash
typo3 personio-jobs:import [--force] [--no-delete] [--no-update] [--dry-run]
```

The following command parameters are available:

| Command parameter       | Description                                              | Required | Default |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------|---------|
| **`-f`**, **`--force`** | Enforce re-import of unchanged jobs                      | ‚Äì        | no      |
| **`--no-delete`**       | Do not delete orphaned jobs                              | ‚Äì        | no      |
| **`--no-update`**       | Do not update imported jobs that have been changed       | ‚Äì        | no      |
| **`--dry-run`**         | Do not perform database operations, only display changes | ‚Äì        | no      |

üí° Increase verbosity with `--verbose` or `-v` to show all changes,
even unchanged jobs that were skipped.

### JSON schema

In combination with [EXT:schema][1], a JSON schema for a single job is included
on job detail pages. It is rendered as type [`JobPosting`][3] and includes some
generic job properties.

**‚ö†Ô∏è The `schema` extension must be installed to use this feature. Read more in
the [installation](#-installation) section above.**
